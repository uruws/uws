# uwsbot

uwsbot implements an scripting engine to run bots scripts against web services to check
and monitor the behavior of use case scenarios.

I'ts [implemented](./go/cmd/uwsbot) in Go, using [mattn/anko](https://github.com/mattn/anko)
interpreter lib.

This is the implementation of the engine. Bots have their own repository:
[MonitoringBots](https://github.com/TalkingPts/MonitoringBots).
